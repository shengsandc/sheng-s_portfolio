# [Project 1: CMJ data processing and analysis]

## [CMJ Analysis Python Tool](https://github.com/shengsandc/CMJ-analysis/blob/5241994d198cac9bfa7b9d90a3d169296753b9c5/CMJ.py)
## [Visualization of the CMJ Performance](https://github.com/shengsandc/CMJ-analysis/blob/500ed6ee0720c13eb4c9b02df1defc3f97fde44c/CMJ_visualisation.py)
This is a python tool I developed to process and analyze ground reaction force data collected from a force plate. This tool essentially analyze CMJ GRF data to understand how athletes jump by interpreting various jumping variable (including strategy-wised, performance-wised).

* Data source: self-collected (sampling rate:1000Hz; sampling duration: 10s; n_force_plates=2; n_trial_per_athlete=3)
* Modules used: pandas, os, numpy, time, glob, matplotlib, seaborn, and textwrap

# [Project 2: Biodiversity Analysis in National Parks]
## [python code for biodiversity analysis](https://github.com/shengsandc/Biodiversity/blob/d6099cd932583d53a5d5d162741ba436c42590f5/biodiversity.ipynb)
This project was aimed to analyze conservation status of species in National Parks. I managed to explore the distribution of species in conservation among categories and National Parks. The project also involved Chi-square test to test out the significance.

* Data source: Codecademy
* MOdules used: pandas, os, numpy, sqlite3, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, itertools and IPython


# [Project 3: A/B test for gym operation]
## [python code for A/B test](https://github.com/shengsandc/sheng_port/blob/0aff84caa6ee79a501c4eceef2a18bb08ae524f6/fitness_test.py)
This goal of the project is to understand whether offering a service of fitness test can affect gym membership application and purchase decision.

* Data source: Codecademy
* Modules used: pandas, matplotlib, scipy, and os
